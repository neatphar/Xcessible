## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

This platform is created for PWDs first and foremost in mind. **Xcessible** is not just another job-hunting platform, it is dedicated to provide you, as well as employers, the most convenient method of communication that removes the unnecessary employment red tape for both employers and PWDs, with an environment that is exclusively **PWD-friendly** and **PWD-dedicated**, allowing employers to specify their employment requirements in richer and more context-aware detail and giving you the job-hunting platform that adapts to your needs and expectations when searching for jobs without the hassle of having to manually filter them out.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

We aim to do a full launch of the project with improved features on **1st of June, 2022**. However our current plan of features include:
- <del>**Accessibility Assistants** to help disabled people browse through the website.</del> Currently needs [enabling](https://medium.com/@Carmichaelize/enabling-the-microphone-camera-in-chrome-for-local-unsecure-origins-9c90c3149339) the ```unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure``` flag.
- <del>**Advanced Search System** with the ability to filter through job posts with _accepted types of disability_</del>.
- **AI-Powered Recommendation System** to suggest jobs to our users based on their profiles and previous interests.
- **Employer Reviews/Ratings** to help users better understand the nature of work at this specific employer.
- **Job Grabber** to web-scrape mutliple resources and filter PwD-suitable job posts.
- **Social Media Platform** to ease communications and connect employers with users.

## üéà Live Demo <a name = "live_demo"></a>
