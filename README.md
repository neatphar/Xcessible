## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options
for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain
focus on defining the problem.

- IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or ‚Äúto be‚Äù state of the process or product. At large, this section
  should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or ‚Äúas is‚Äù state of the process or product.
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
  This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üéà Live Demo <a name = "live_demo"></a>

You can try out the Jenkins server and the three deployed versions using these links. However, due to the unnecessary cost of running a VM these links will be valid until **29th of November, 2021**.

- Jenkins Server: http://167.172.189.104:90
- Live Demo: http://167.172.189.104
